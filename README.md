# Dungeon Game
DungeonGame is a 2D Dungeon Crawler game with RPG elements inspired by D&amp;D where players explore procedurally generated dungeons, battle enemies using swords and magic, and uncover hidden treasures.

## Features
- **Procedural Dungeons**: Each dungeon is uniquely generated, providing a fresh experience every time.
- **Combat System**: The combat system is turb-based combat driven by Initiative rounds, you can select your Action and Bonus Action in a variety of possibilities.
- **Dungeon Crawl**: Delve deeper into the Dungeon or get back to the surface to restock on resources, sell items or buy new equipment, fight monsters and bosses in this pixel-art environment.
- **Level Up**: Each time you defeat an enemy you gain EXP, and with enough EXP you level up, making your character grow stronger and unlock new spells or unique abilities for each different class.
- **Challenging Bosses**: Face powerful enemies that test your skills and strategy.
